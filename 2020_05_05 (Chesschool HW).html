<p> Jimmy was an ordinary boy who lived with ordinary parents in an ordinary house.
</P> <p> But he had a huge head and he never talked at school because he was a shy like a blossom in spring.
</P> <p> One day, he flew up into the sky and found a reason why he went there. It was because he locked a brainstorm in his head. After he went down, he became the most popular boy in school because he talked about many stories to his friends.
</P> <p> Jimmy is not shy anymore.
