<p> I would rather have a magic pencil that could make anything I drew come to life.
</P> <p> First, I would make a magic eraser with the magic pencil.  Think about how cool it would be.  You could erase some money that is owned by someone if you want revenge on them for some reason, and you could erase someone's pants!
</P> <p> Second, I would draw a magic private mansion for my family.  This mansion will be really small but when you step into the house, magically everything will look big to you.  I would also make a magical building like a five star hotel or a submarine house.
</P> <p> Third, I would hire an artist to draw money.  I would be rich if I drew money.  I have always wanted to go to Universal studio many times, and if I could be a millionaire, you I could do that!
</P> <p> If I had a magic eraser it wouldnâ€™t be very useful for me because I couldn't make a magic pencil with it.  However, I could make a magic eraser with a magic pencil.  Therefore, I think it would be much better to be able to have a magic pencil.
